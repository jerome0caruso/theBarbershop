I wanted to make a single page application that was responsive with node and vanilla JavaScript.  This was a great way to get familiar with node and express basics and using OOP to create the page views.  I didn't focus too much on styling or major visual effects but I did make it responsive with flexbox and media queries.  The server.js file uses app.get to send all responses/paths to index.html, from there, the front-end decides which view to render depending on the path entered or clicked on.  This is done in the router function in index.js.  Also in index.js I used the history api so there is no refreshes when moving through the pages even with back or forwards movments.  All the views are done with OOP style of programming and they all have a getHTML method whichs renders the html for each page, this is instantiated in the variable 'view' in the index.js file.  They use the abstractView class to set all the title's for the pages and get extended from each class.  I might be added more features sometime in the future.
